Decided to make my first small project from scratch. It is a choose your own
adventure game made with what I learned this past week at a Galvanize meetup.  
Its uses simple DOM(specifically the classList & add/removeEventListener), html, and css

Lots of redundant code. But this is merely version 1. I plan on making better versions of this
project as I progress in the understandings of these languages.
