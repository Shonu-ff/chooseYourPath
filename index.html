        <p>You quickly make you way up the mountain side.
        But what you didn't realize the rope ladder was made of onion.
        You still were able to cry your way up to the mountain top...
        Reeking of onions, while pushing away tears, you spot a treasure chest.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock.</p>

        <p>Instead of directly bringing you to the island, Chuck makes you tag a long with him.
        He brings you to his buddies place for a couple hours, where they drank beers and smoked cigarettes.
        Finally, and drunkenly, Chuck swims you over to the island.
        Now hungover, you puke all over youself.
        While washing away your mess, you spot a treasure chest.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock.</p>

        <p>SINKT! You hear it hit a surface and it automatically starts lifiting you up. over the edge of the crater</p>
        <p>Then, someone approaches you from behind...</p>
        <p>ITS BATMAN!</p>
        <p>He tells you about a cloud of marshmallows that catches you at the bottom of the crater.
        He also says at the bottom of the crater there was a treasure chest with a jetpack inside of it.
        Sadly, you notice the jetpack strapped around Batman's chest...
        He offers you a lift back home. To which you accept</p>

      <div id="adventure3a" class="adventure">
        <p>You see the rope ladder but decide to keep going strong on your own.
        Now 3 quarters the way up the mountain face, you find a ledge for some rest.
        On the ledge is a pizza with a full pizza untouched pizza pie inside.
        You happily munch on, and rest.</p>
        <p> After the break, you set target to the summit...
        With a full stomach you make it safely to the top.
        Looking around at Earth's glory...you spot a treasure chest a few feet behind you.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock.</p>

        <p>Backstroking away, you bump into a turtle who also speaks English.
        He introduces himself as Ron and asks you why you are floating in the middle of the ocean.
        You tell him about your journey to the island and about meeting Chuck.
        He laughs and says Chuck is a weirdo and that you were lucky you chose not to take a ride from him.
        <p>Ron, then offers you a ride to the island.</p>
        You grab on and he darts his way through the waves to the beaches of the island.
        While, waving goodbye to Ron, you spot a treasure chest a couple yards into the island.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock</p>

        <p>Plummeting towards the bottom of the crater you decide to close your eyes.</p>
        Thinking in your mind, you should have used that Batrope, when you had the chance.
        Then suddenly, you are hit in the face with a cloud like pillow.
        <p>Upon opening your eyes, you see you've landed on a giant mound of marshmallows
        Slinding down, whilst eating a few mallows, you get to the crater floor...
