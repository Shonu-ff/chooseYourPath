      <!-- Part 3 of adventure -->
      <div id="adventure3Ladder" class="adventure">
        <p>You quickly make you way up the mountain side.</p>
        <p>But what you didn't realize the rope ladder was made of onion.</p>
        <p>You still were able to cry your way up to the mountain top...</p>
        <p>Reeking of onions, while pushing away tears, you spot a treasure chest.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock.</p>
      </div>
      <button id="button3Ladder">OPEN TREASURE CHEST</button>
      <div id="adventure3Dolphin" class="adventure">
        <p>Instead of directly bringing you to the island, Chuck makes you tag a long with him.</p>
        <p>He brings you to his buddies place for a couple hours, where they drank beers and smoked cigarettes.</p>
        <p>Finally, and drunkenly, Chuck swims you over to the island.</p>
        <p>Now hungover, you puke all over youself.</p>
        <p>While washing away your mess, you spot a treasure chest.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock.</p>

      <button id="button3Dolphin">OPEN TREASURE CHEST</button>
      <div id="adventure3Batrope" class="adventure">
        <p>BOOM! You shoot the bat rope aiming it as high as you can.</p>
        <p>SINKT! You hear it hit a surface and it automatically starts lifiting you up.</p>
        <p>Finally, you make your way over the edge of the crater. You are happily back on land.</p>
        <p>Then, someone approaches you from behind...</p>
        <p>ITS BATMAN!</p>
        <p>He tells you about a cloud of marshmellows that catches you at the bottom of the crater.</p>
        <p>He also says at the bottom of the crater there was a treasure chest with a jetpack inside of it.</p>
        <p>Sadly, you notice the jetpack strapped around Batman's chest...</p>
        <p>He offers you a lift back home.</p>
        <p>Empty handed and jetpackless you wave by to the crater.</p>

      <div id="adventure3a" class="adventure">
        <p>You see the rope ladder but decide to keep going strong on your own.</p>
        <p>Now 3 quarters the way up the mountain face, you find a ledge for some rest.</p>
        <p>On the ledge is a pizza with a full pizza untouched pizza pie inside.</p>
        <p>You happily munch on, and rest.</p>
        <p> After the break, you set target to the summit...</p>
        <p>With a full stomach you make it safely to the top.</p>
        <p>Looking around at Earth's glory...you spot a treasure chest a few feet behind you.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock.</p>

      <button id="button3a">OPEN TREASURE CHEST</button>
      <div id="adventure3b" class="adventure">
        <p>Backstroking away, you bump into a turtle who also speaks English.</p>
        <p>He introduces himself as Ron and asks you why you are floating in the middle of the ocean.</p>
        <p>You tell him about your journey to the island and about meeting Chuck.</p>
        <p>He laughs and says Chuck is a weirdo and that you were lucky you chose not to take a ride from him.</p>
        <p>Ron, then offers you a ride to the island.</p>
        <p>You grab on and he darts his way through the waves to the beaches of the island.</p>
        <p>While, waving goodbye to Ron, you spot a treasure chest a couple yards into the island.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock</p>

        <p>Plummeting towards the bottom of the crater you decide to close your eyes.</p>
        <p>Thinking in your mind, you should have used that Batrope, when you had the chance.</p>
        <p>Then suddenly, you are hit in the face with a cloud like pillow.</p>
        <p>Upon opening your eyes, you see you've landed on a giant mound of marshmallows</p>
        <p>Slinding down, whilst eating a few, you get to the crater floor...</p>
        <p>Looking around you spot a treasure chest.</p>
        <p>Upon inspection, you see that it has the key inside the lock.</p>

        <p>Puzzled, you see underneath the letter 5 20 dollar bills.</p>
